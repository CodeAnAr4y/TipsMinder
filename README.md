# Tips-Minder

A modern **Single Page Application (SPA)** built with **Angular 21** using **Vite** as a build tool.
The project demonstrates best practices for Angular architecture, asynchronous data handling, UI development with Tailwind CSS, and data visualization using ECharts.

The application fetches data from the **DummyJSON API** and provides a structured dashboard with cards, tables, charts, and transaction details.
Additionally, it includes an **extra real-time chat module implemented with WebSocket over ws.ifelse.io**.
